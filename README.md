## Problem Statement

This two pages tool helps a user find a house based on their unique requirements. A user will find variety of views to help him evaluate current listings in the Austin, Texas area.

There are 4 tabs with different information user can find:

## Summary View: 
#### An overview of current properties available in Austin, Texas, including metrics around pricing, living area size, and lot size.

From 15171 properties: 

- 93,87% are Single Family Houses
- 3.1% are Condos
- 3.03% others

Median Price for the Single Family Houses is
- 409.900$ 
and Average Price is 
- 516.388$. 
The signal is that Average price shows us that there are some very expensive homes nad Median Price in this case is a better indicator for what a typical buyer might pay.

User can find there in which area based on zipcode can find the most amount of properties or available properties by the year houses were built.

## Location View:
#### An interactive map to help a user find the right properties for their search.

A user can use the slicer with Home Prices to highlight dots in the map. Based on the price user will chose, remaining properties are in red color, the rest from outside of range are in grey color.

## School View:
#### Evaluate Austin, Texas properties based on nearby schools and find communities in the area that fit your family's education preferences.

Picking one of 3 categories
- Student Per Teacher (Small Classes, Medium Classes or Large Classes)

And all based on zipcode.

Other information:

# DICE ROLLS

This script was created for users. When the script runs, it will ask a user how many dice they want to roll and how many sides each die will have.
Then it randomly rolls those dice and prints the results. Every time a user hits Enter, the dice are rolled again. 
If a user enter "q", then the script quits and stops running.

# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

This script is a very simple implementation of the game Rock Paper Scissors. 
If you are unfamiliar with the game, here is how it works. Two players each pick their move: Rock, Paper or Scissors. Each move beats one other move and loses to one other move:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

Your implementation will be a one player game that has a computer "AI" that randomly picks a move.
